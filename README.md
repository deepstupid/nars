## Negative Attitudes towards Robots Scale

https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/9641/SyrdalDDautenhahn.pdf

**The Negative Attitudes towards Robots Scale
(NARS)**. The NARS was developed using a lexical method, in
which its developers created a scale based on free-form
responses from participants regarding anxieties towards robots
(Nomura and Kanda 2003). This later formed the **NARS
Scale**, and was used successfully to explain differences in
participants' behaviour in live **Human-Robot Interaction** (HRI)
studies [8, 9]. Nomura et al. [10] also examined the
relationship between the NARS scale and the **Robot Anxiety
Scale (RAS)** with participants' behaviour in a HRI trial. The
NARS has also been proposed as a means of gauging changes
in attitudes towards robots over time as a result of prolonged
interactions [11]. These possible applications make the use of
such a scale interesting for both general HRI research across
different robot types, as well as studying how prolonged
relationships with robot companions may influence potential
users' attitudes towards robots.
